/*
        Thread v/s Runnable:
            1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support
               multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other
               base classes.
            2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some
               inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
            3. Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
